The project aims to develop an AI-assisted diagnostic system for primary lymphoedema based on lymphoscintigraphy, where the lymphatic system is imaged following injection of a radioactive tracer. Current work—funded by the MRC and BHF—integrates genetics, microscopy, MRI, and imaging to understand disease mechanisms. Although lymphoscintigrams show distinct patterns across patient groups (e.g., Milroy, LDS) and healthy individuals, interpretation remains difficult without expert review.



The first phase will manually define key imaging features (e.g., node size, location, connectivity, and channel presence) for classification using a random forest model. In later stages, the project envisions leveraging \*\*neurosymbolic AI\*\* to move beyond standard pattern recognition. By combining neural methods for automatic feature detection with symbolic reasoning to model anatomical and physiological relationships, neurosymbolic AI could enhance both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. This hybrid approach would enable systems to reason about clinically meaningful structures-similar to expert assessment-while remaining transparent and verifiable. The team plans to seek additional funding to develop this neurosymbolic component in collaboration with the network.
