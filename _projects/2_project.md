## Neurosymbolic AI for Medicine (Kick-off Meeting, 4–5 July 2024)

The kick-off meeting launched the **Neurosymbolic AI for Medicine** network, bringing together researchers to define how neural learning and symbolic reasoning can be combined for safer, more transparent medical AI. Participants discussed definitions and boundaries of NeSy systems, their importance for integrating diverse medical data and clinical knowledge, and the challenges of bias, explainability, and regulation. The network agreed to produce a **white paper and roadmap**, and build a shared platform for collaboration and resources—laying the foundation for a global community advancing trustworthy, knowledge-driven AI in healthcare.


### Defining Neurosymbolic AI
Participants discussed how to define *neurosymbolic AI (NeSy-AI)*, highlighting the tension between narrow definitions—where neural and symbolic components are tightly integrated—and broader interpretations that include systems such as knowledge-graph embeddings or neural models interacting with symbolic reasoners.

The group agreed that **LLMs are not inherently neurosymbolic**, though they can become so when combined with reasoning or planning modules. Six categories of NeSy systems were reviewed, ranging from loosely coupled hybrids to hypothetical, fully integrated architectures.

### Why NeSy-AI is Essential in Medicine
NeSy-AI can address core limitations of current deep-learning systems by enabling:

- **Integration of diverse data sources** (imaging, text, genomics, clinical records)
- **Incorporation of biomedical knowledge** (ontologies such as SNOMED, UMLS, Gene Ontology)
- **Transparent and verifiable reasoning**, essential for clinical safety and regulation
- **Improved performance with small or biased datasets** through symbolic constraints and transfer learning
- **Multimodal and process-level reasoning** for complex care pathways and causal relationships

---

### Challenges and Barriers
Key obstacles identified include:

- Limited **regulatory clarity** and liability frameworks for AI-assisted decision-making  
- **Poor data capture and documentation**, with little clinician incentive to record structured information  
- **Disconnect between ontologies and clinical reality**, reducing applicability  
- Risk of **systematic bias and errors** in both human and AI decision processes

---

### Opportunities and Use Cases
NeSy-AI offers promising applications such as:

- **Human-in-the-loop systems** maintaining clinician control  
- **Explainable medical imaging** and artefact detection  
- **Drug repurposing and personalised medicine**  
- **Clinical documentation assistance** and multimodal reasoning  
- **Symbolic bias-mitigation and fairness checking**

---

### Network Plans and Actions
The network will:

- Draft a **white paper and roadmap** defining priorities and opportunities for NeSy-AI in medicine  
- **Organise a workshop** with leading researchers (target: 2025)  
- Build a **community platform** (GitHub, website, social media) for datasets, teaching materials, and collaboration  
- Pursue **funding opportunities** (EPSRC, COST, HDR UK, EU Horizon) and foster consortia for larger projects  
- Conduct **case studies** on clinical scenarios (e.g., preterm care, imaging artefacts) to demonstrate impact  

---

### Next Steps
- Assign leads for key areas: motivation, literature review, datasets/resources, use cases, and legal/ethical aspects  
- Establish monthly meetings and clinician engagement channels  
- Connect with policy and clinical partners (e.g., Turing Institute, NHS)

---

### Outcome
The meeting established a shared vision for **Neurosymbolic AI in Medicine**:  
to develop hybrid systems that combine the learning power of neural models with the transparency, reasoning, and domain knowledge of symbolic approaches—toward safer, fairer, and more trustworthy medical AI.
