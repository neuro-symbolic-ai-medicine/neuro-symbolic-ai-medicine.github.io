The [18th International Conference on Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning](https://sites.google.com/view/nesy2024) (NeSy 2024), held in Barcelona, was co-organised by Network members Artur Garcez and Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz. Several other members also attended, and the event provided an excellent opportunity to hold an informal meet-up to continue the discussions initiated during the kick-off meeting in Zurich. The Network was also promoted throughout the conference to raise awareness and engage experts interested in applying neurosymbolic AI to medicine.

NeSy 2024 spanned three days (9â€“12 September) and featured a mix of keynote talks, spotlight sessions, poster presentations, tutorials, and thematic tracks. The three keynotes were delivered by Catia Pesquita (University of Lisbon), Kristian Kersting (TU Darmstadt), and Willem (Jelle) Zuidema (University of Amsterdam). The conference explored topics such as explainability, foundation models, knowledge-graph embeddings, abductive reasoning, procedural knowledge, and hybrid methods combining symbolic and neural AI. 

The [NeSy conference series](https://nesyconf.org/) are organised by [Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning Association](https://nesy-ai.org/).
