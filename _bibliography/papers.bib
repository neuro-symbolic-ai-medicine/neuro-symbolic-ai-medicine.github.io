  abstract={The goal of neural-symbolic computation is to integrate
   robust connectionist learning and sound symbolic reasoning.
   With the recent advances in connectionist learning, in particular
   deep neural networks, forms of representation learning have emerged. 
   However, such representations have not become useful for reasoning.
   Results from neural-symbolic computation have shown to offer powerful 
   alternatives for knowledge representation, learning and reasoning in
   neural computation. This paper recalls the main contributions and 
   discusses key challenges for neural-symbolic integration which have
   been identified at a recent Dagstuhl seminar.},
