Pascal Hitzler, a member of the Network was one of the co-organisers.</p> <p>Over the past decade, <strong>deep learning (DL)</strong> and <strong>knowledge graphs (KGs)</strong> have achieved major breakthroughs. DL has advanced through large-scale data, transformer models, and modern hardware, while KGs have matured thanks to web-scale integration, standardization, and improved reasoning methods. These parallel developments have sparked growing interest in how the two can complement each other.</p> <p>Although DL models—especially large language models (LLMs)—excel across many tasks, they often struggle with factual accuracy. In contrast, <strong>KGs provide structured, curated knowledge</strong> that supports transparency and reasoning, though their creation remains resource-intensive.</p> <p>This <strong>Dagstuhl Seminar</strong> explored how to bridge DL and KGs through <strong>neurosymbolic AI</strong>, focusing on:</p> <ul> <li>Grounding neural models in symbolic knowledge</li> <li>Enhancing explainability, robustness, and causal reasoning</li> <li>Using DL to automate KG construction</li> <li>Exploring biologically inspired approaches for human-like learning</li> </ul> <p>A dedicated working group examined real-world applications, identifying (bio)medicine as a particularly relevant and impactful domain for neurosymbolic AI.</p> <p><em>A report and white paper is currently being finalized</em>.</p> </body></html>
